## Executive Summary

The Fight Tracking System analyzes PUBG competitive matches to detect and characterize team fights, providing detailed combat analytics for teams and players. The system processes telemetry data to identify meaningful combat engagements, distinguish them from executions or incidental damage, and track outcomes for all participating teams and players.

### Key Capabilities

- **Fight Detection**: Identifies 22.4 fights per match on average
- **Player Analysis**: Tracks individual performance across 5.46M participant records
- **Team Metrics**: Calculates fight win rates (Combatability metric)
- **Multi-Team Support**: Handles third-party engagements (44% of all fights)
- **Playstyle Classification**: Categorizes players by combat approach

### Production Deployment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Matches Analyzed | 36,687 (96.4% coverage) |
| Total Fights | 824,133 |
| Total Participants | 5,460,927 |
| Tracked Players | 355 |
| Processing Rate | 9.5 matches/sec |

## Algorithm Design

### Version History

**V1 (Deprecated)**:
- Only detected fights with 2+ knocks
- Single winner/loser per fight
- No execution filtering
- Binary classification

**V2 (Current - Production)**:
- Damage-based detection
- Per-team outcomes (multi-team support)
- Smart execution filtering
- 4-level priority classification
- NPC filtering

### Detection Rules (Priority Order)

#### **Rule 1: Multiple Casualties** (ALWAYS a fight)
```
IF 2+ players knocked or killed
THEN classify as fight
REASON: Multiple casualties = combat occurred, risk was taken
```

**Examples**:
- 4v4 compound rush, wipe all 4 → ✅ Fight
- 2v2, both teams lose one player → ✅ Fight

#### **Rule 2: Single Instant Kill with Resistance**
```
IF 1 instant kill (no knock) occurred
THEN check victim resistance:
  - 4v1 or worse imbalance: Victim must deal 75+ damage
  - 4v2 imbalance: Victim must deal 50+ damage
  - Even teams: Victim must deal 25+ damage
  ELSE: Execution (not a fight)
```

**Examples**:
- 4v1 instant kill, victim 0 damage → ❌ Not a fight (execution)
- 4v1 instant kill, victim deals 80 damage → ✅ Fight (fought back)
- 2v2 instant kill, victim deals 30 damage → ✅ Fight

#### **Rule 3: Reciprocal Damage** (No casualties required)
```
IF combined damage ≥ 150 HP
AND both teams deal damage
AND each team deals ≥ 20% of total
THEN classify as fight
REASON: Sustained firefight without casualties
```

**Examples**:
- Long-range stalemate, 250/350 damage exchanged → ✅ Fight
- 160 damage dealt, 5 damage received → ❌ Not a fight (one-sided)

#### **Rule 4: Single Knock with Return Fire**
```
IF 1 knock occurred
AND both teams deal ≥ 75 damage each
THEN classify as fight
REASON: Reciprocal engagement with casualties
```

**Examples**:
- Single knock, both teams 80+ damage → ✅ Fight
- Single opportunistic snipe, 100/0 damage → ❌ Not a fight

### NPC Filtering

The system filters out AI bots to prevent false positives:

```python
NPC_NAMES = {
    "Commander",
    "Guard",
    "Pillar",
    "SkySoldier",
    "Soldier",
    "PillarSoldier",
    "ZombieSoldier",
}
```

All combat events involving NPCs are excluded from fight detection.

### Outcome Determination

#### **For 2-Team Fights**:

```python
if team_wipe_occurred:
    winner = surviving_team
    outcome = "DECISIVE_WIN"
elif death_diff >= 2:
    winner = team_with_fewer_deaths
    outcome = "DECISIVE_WIN"
elif death_diff == 1 and total_deaths >= 2:
    winner = team_with_fewer_deaths
    outcome = "MARGINAL_WIN"
else:
    outcome = "DRAW"
```

#### **For Multi-Team Fights (3+ teams)**:

```python
# Always one loser: team with most deaths
loser = team_with_most_deaths

# Always one winner: best performance
winner = team_with_most_kills
if tied:
    winner = team_with_most_knocks
if still_tied:
    winner = team_with_most_damage

# Everyone else: DRAW
for team in other_teams:
    team_outcome = "DRAW"

outcome = "THIRD_PARTY"
```

### Configuration Constants

```python
ENGAGEMENT_WINDOW = timedelta(seconds=45)  # Rolling window since last event
MAX_ENGAGEMENT_DISTANCE = 300  # Fixed radius from fight center (meters)
MAX_FIGHT_DURATION = timedelta(seconds=240)  # Maximum total fight duration
```

**Rationale**:
- **45s window**: Allows for revives, repositioning, re-engagements
- **300m radius**: Typical medium-range combat distance in PUBG
- **240s duration**: Prevents infinite fights, captures extended battles

## Implementation Details

### Core Processor Flow

```python
class FightTrackingProcessor:
    def process_match_fights(self, events, match_id, match_data) -> List[Dict]:
        """
        Main entry point for fight detection.

        Returns:
            List of fight records, each containing:
                - Fight metadata (match_id, times, duration)
                - Team data (team_ids, outcomes)
                - Statistics (knocks, kills, damage)
                - Participants list (embedded)
        """
        # 1. Cluster combat events into engagements
        engagements = self._cluster_combat_events(events)

        # 2. Filter and classify each engagement
        fights = []
        for engagement in engagements:
            if self._is_fight(engagement):
                # 3. Enrich with full statistics
                fight_record = self._enrich_engagement(engagement, events)

                # 4. Determine outcomes
                outcome_data = self._determine_outcomes(fight_record)
                fight_record.update(outcome_data)

                # 5. Extract participant data
                participants = self._extract_participants(fight_record, events)
                fight_record["participants"] = participants

                fights.append(fight_record)

        return fights
```

### Critical Fix (October 2025)

**Problem**: Fight participants weren't being inserted during backfill.

**Root Cause**:
1. Processor returned `(fights, participants)` as separate lists
2. No association between fights and their participants
3. `insert_fight_participants()` didn't include `fight_id` field
4. Foreign key constraint violations silently rejected inserts

**Solution**:
1. Changed processor to return fights with embedded participants
2. Added `insert_fight_and_get_id()` using RETURNING clause
3. Updated worker to insert fights sequentially and get IDs
4. Modified `insert_fight_participants()` to include `fight_id`

**Code Changes**:

```python
# Worker code (telemetry_processing_worker.py)
fights = self.fight_processor.process_match_fights(events, match_id, data)

for fight in fights:
    # Extract participants before inserting fight
    participants = fight.pop("participants", [])

    # Insert fight and get ID
    fight_id = self.database_manager.insert_fight_and_get_id(fight)

    # Add fight_id to each participant and insert
    if participants:
        for participant in participants:
            participant["fight_id"] = fight_id
        self.database_manager.insert_fight_participants(participants)
```

**Result**: Full backfill successfully populated 5.46M participant records with 100% data integrity.

### Event Clustering Algorithm

```python
def _cluster_combat_events(self, events):
    """
    Groups related combat events into engagements.

    Clustering criteria:
    - Events within 60s of each other
    - Events within 500m of engagement center
    - Involves same teams (or overlapping teams)

    Returns:
        List of engagement objects, each containing:
            - All related combat events
            - Participating teams
            - Time range
            - Geographic bounds
    """
    engagements = []
    current_engagement = None

    for event in sorted(events, key=lambda e: e["timestamp"]):
        if self._should_start_new_engagement(event, current_engagement):
            if current_engagement:
                engagements.append(current_engagement)
            current_engagement = self._create_new_engagement(event)
        else:
            self._add_event_to_engagement(event, current_engagement)

    return engagements
```

### Participant Enrichment

For each player in a fight, the system tracks:

```python
participant_record = {
    "fight_id": fight_id,  # FK to team_fights
    "match_id": match_id,
    "player_name": player_name,
    "player_account_id": account_id,
    "team_id": team_id,

    # Combat metrics
    "knocks_dealt": int,
    "kills_dealt": int,
    "damage_dealt": float,
    "damage_taken": float,
    "attacks_made": int,

    # Positioning
    "position_center_x": float,
    "position_center_y": float,

    # Outcome
    "was_knocked": bool,
    "was_killed": bool,
    "survived": bool,

    # Timestamps
    "knocked_at": datetime (nullable),
    "killed_at": datetime (nullable),
    "match_datetime": datetime,
}
```

## Usage & Queries

### Basic Fight Queries

**Get all fights in a match**:
```sql
SELECT
    id,
    fight_start_time,
    duration_seconds,
    array_length(team_ids, 1) as num_teams,
    outcome,
    total_knocks,
    total_kills,
    total_damage,
    fight_reason
FROM team_fights
WHERE match_id = 'your-match-id'
ORDER BY fight_start_time;
```

**Find intense fights (high casualties)**:
```sql
SELECT
    match_id,
    fight_start_time,
    array_length(team_ids, 1) as num_teams,
    total_knocks + total_kills as total_casualties,
    duration_seconds,
    ROUND(total_damage, 0) as damage,
    outcome
FROM team_fights
WHERE total_knocks + total_kills >= 15
ORDER BY total_knocks + total_kills DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Third-party fights**:
```sql
SELECT
    match_id,
    array_length(team_ids, 1) as num_teams,
    COUNT(*) as fight_count,
    ROUND(AVG(duration_seconds), 1) as avg_duration,
    ROUND(AVG(total_knocks + total_kills), 1) as avg_casualties
FROM team_fights
WHERE array_length(team_ids, 1) >= 3
GROUP BY match_id, array_length(team_ids, 1)
ORDER BY num_teams DESC, fight_count DESC;
```

### Team Performance Queries

**Team Combatability (fight win rate)**:
```sql
SELECT
    team_id,
    fights_entered,
    fights_won,
    fights_lost,
    fights_drawn,
    win_rate_pct as combatability,
    survival_rate_pct,
    avg_knocks_per_fight,
    avg_damage_per_fight
FROM team_combatability_metrics
WHERE fights_entered >= 10
ORDER BY win_rate_pct DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Team's fight history**:
```sql
SELECT
    tf.match_id,
    tf.fight_start_time,
    tf.duration_seconds,
    tf.outcome,
    tf.team_outcomes->'5' as my_team_outcome,  -- Replace 5 with team_id
    array_length(tf.team_ids, 1) as num_teams,
    tf.total_knocks,
    tf.total_damage,
    tf.fight_reason
FROM team_fights tf
WHERE 5 = ANY(tf.team_ids)  -- Replace 5 with team_id
ORDER BY tf.fight_start_time DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Player Performance Queries

**Player fight statistics** (tracked players only):
```sql
SELECT
    fp.player_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT fp.fight_id) as total_fights,
    COUNT(DISTINCT fp.match_id) as matches,

    -- Combat metrics
    SUM(fp.knocks_dealt) as total_knocks,
    SUM(fp.kills_dealt) as total_kills,
    ROUND(AVG(fp.damage_dealt), 0) as avg_damage_per_fight,
    SUM(fp.damage_dealt) as total_damage,

    -- Survival
    SUM(CASE WHEN fp.survived THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as fights_survived,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN fp.survived THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1)
        as survival_rate,

    -- Efficiency
    ROUND(SUM(fp.knocks_dealt)::numeric / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0), 2) as knocks_per_fight,
    ROUND(SUM(fp.kills_dealt)::numeric / NULLIF(SUM(fp.knocks_dealt), 0), 2)
        as conversion_rate
FROM fight_participants fp
INNER JOIN players p ON fp.player_name = p.player_name  -- Only tracked players
GROUP BY fp.player_name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT fp.fight_id) >= 20
ORDER BY total_fights DESC;
```

**Player playstyle classification**:
```sql
WITH player_stats AS (
    SELECT
        fp.player_name,
        COUNT(*) as fights,
        ROUND(SUM(fp.knocks_dealt)::numeric / COUNT(*), 2) as knocks_per_fight,

        ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN fp.survived THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1)
            as survival_rate
    FROM fight_participants fp
    INNER JOIN players p ON fp.player_name = p.player_name
    GROUP BY fp.player_name
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 100
)
SELECT
    player_name,

### Analysis Queries

**Fight duration percentiles**:
```sql
SELECT
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.10) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_seconds) as p10,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_seconds) as p25,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_seconds) as median,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_seconds) as p75,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.90) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_seconds) as p90,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_seconds) as p95,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.99) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_seconds) as p99
FROM team_fights;
```

**Match fight intensity**:

    COUNT(*) as num_fights,
    ROUND(AVG(duration_seconds), 1) as avg_duration,
    ROUND(AVG(total_knocks + total_kills), 1) as avg_casualties,
    SUM(CASE WHEN array_length(team_ids, 1) >= 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as third_party_fights,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN array_length(team_ids, 1) >= 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) /
          COUNT(*), 1) as third_party_pct
FROM team_fights
GROUP BY match_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: No fights detected in match**

Possible causes:
1. Match had no combat (rare in competitive)
2. Only NPC kills (training mode, bot matches)
3. All combat events filtered by execution rules

**Check**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as event_count
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM json_array_elements(telemetry_data->'events')
    WHERE value->>'_T' IN ('LogPlayerKillV2', 'LogPlayerTakeDamage')
) events;
```

---

**Issue: Participants missing for fights**

This was a critical bug fixed in October 2025. If you're seeing this:

**Check**:
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT tf.id) as total_fights,
    COUNT(DISTINCT fp.fight_id) as fights_with_participants,
    COUNT(*) as total_participants
FROM team_fights tf
LEFT JOIN fight_participants fp ON tf.id = fp.fight_id;
```

**If counts don't match**, ensure:
1. Using latest code (post Oct 11, 2025)
2. `insert_fight_and_get_id()` method exists
3. `fight_participants.fight_id` is included in INSERT
4. Worker calls processor correctly

---

**Issue: High third-party rate**

This is expected in PUBG competitive play (44% is normal).

**Verify it's not a bug**:
```sql
-- Check if 3-team fights are being detected correctly
SELECT
    match_id,
    fight_start_time,
    team_ids,
    array_length(team_ids, 1) as num_teams,
    outcome,
    team_outcomes
FROM team_fights
WHERE array_length(team_ids, 1) = 3
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 10;
```

---

**Issue: Unrealistic fight durations**

**Check extremes**:
```sql
SELECT
    match_id,
    fight_start_time,
    fight_end_time,
    duration_seconds,
    total_knocks + total_kills as casualties
FROM team_fights
WHERE duration_seconds > 200 OR duration_seconds < 5
ORDER BY duration_seconds DESC;
```

If seeing >240s durations, check `MAX_FIGHT_DURATION` constant.

---

**Issue: Performance slow on backfill**

**Optimize**:
```python
# Use multi-core processing
python scripts/backfill_fight_tracking.py --workers 16

# Batch size adjustment
python scripts/backfill_fight_tracking.py --batch-size 50

# Limit for testing
python scripts/backfill_fight_tracking.py --limit 100
```

**Monitor progress**:
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE fights_processed = TRUE) as processed,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE fights_processed = FALSE) as remaining,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE fights_processed = TRUE) / COUNT(*), 1)
        as pct_complete
FROM matches
WHERE game_type IN ('competitive', 'official');
```

---

**Issue: Combatability metrics not updating**

**Refresh materialized view**:
```sql
SELECT refresh_team_combatability();
```

**Or manually**:
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY team_combatability_metrics;
```

---

### Debugging Tips

**Enable detailed logging**:
```python
# In fight_tracking_processor.py
if self.logger:
    self.logger.debug(f"Processing engagement: {len(events)} events")
    self.logger.debug(f"Teams involved: {team_ids}")
    self.logger.debug(f"Fight reason: {reason}")
```

**Check fight detection logic**:
```python
# Add this to processor for testing
def _debug_engagement(self, engagement):
    print(f"Engagement: {engagement['start_time']} - {engagement['end_time']}")
    print(f"Teams: {engagement['team_ids']}")
    print(f"Casualties: {len(engagement['casualties'])}")
    print(f"Total damage: {engagement['total_damage']}")
    print(f"Is fight: {self._is_fight(engagement)}")
```

**Validate data integrity**:
```sql
-- Check for orphaned participants
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fight_participants fp
LEFT JOIN team_fights tf ON fp.fight_id = tf.id
WHERE tf.id IS NULL;
-- Should be 0

-- Check for NULL fight_ids
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fight_participants
WHERE fight_id IS NULL;
-- Should be 0

-- Check for mismatched match_ids
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fight_participants fp
JOIN team_fights tf ON fp.fight_id = tf.id
WHERE fp.match_id != tf.match_id;
-- Should be 0
```
