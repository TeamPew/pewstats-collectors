## Overview

The finishing metrics system tracks:

### Core Metrics
- **Knock-to-kill conversion rate** - Percentage of knocks converted to kills
- **Knock distance** - Distance from attacker to victim at knock time
- **Teammate positioning** - Proximity of teammates when knock occurs
- **Time to finish** - Seconds between knock and kill
- **Outcome tracking** - Killed vs revived

### Advanced Metrics
- Distance buckets (CQC, Close, Medium, Long, Very Long)
- Headshot knock rate
- Wallbang knocks
- Vehicle-based knocks
- Team spread variance
- Teammates within range (50m/100m/200m)

## Database Tables

### `player_knock_events` (Event-level data)
Stores every knock with full context including:
- Player positions (attacker, victim)
- Combat details (weapon, damage type, distance)
- Teammate proximity metrics
- Outcome (killed/revived)
- Match context

**733 events** tracked across 10 test matches

### `player_finishing_summary` (Aggregated stats)
Per-match, per-player statistics:
- Conversion rates and averages
- Distance breakdowns
- Team positioning metrics
- Quality metrics (headshots, etc.)

**371 unique players** tracked across 10 test matches

## Key Findings (10 Match Test)

### Distance Analysis
- Average knock distance: **67.0m**
- Most common: **10-50m** (44.4% of knocks)
- Longest tracked: **359.2m**

### Conversion Rates by Distance
- CQC (0-10m): **75.3%**
- Close (10-50m): **74.6%**
- Medium (50-100m): **74.7%**
- Long (100-200m): **63.2%**
- Very Long (200m+): **66.7%**

### Teammate Proximity Impact
- Very close (<25m): **67.3%** conversion
- Close (25-50m): **75.2%** conversion
- Medium (50-100m): **79.1%** conversion ⭐ (sweet spot!)
- Distant (100-200m): **71.0%** conversion
- Isolated (200m+): **92.3%** conversion (skilled solo players)

## Usage

### Process Matches
```bash
python3 docs/process-finishing-metrics.py
```

### Apply Migration
```bash
psql -f docs/finishing-metrics-migration.sql
```

### Query Data
```sql
-- Top finishers
SELECT
    player_name,
    SUM(total_knocks) as knocks,
    ROUND(AVG(finishing_rate), 1) as finish_rate
FROM player_finishing_summary
GROUP BY player_name
HAVING SUM(total_knocks) >= 10
ORDER BY finish_rate DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Integration

To integrate into production telemetry worker:

1. Copy processing logic from `process-finishing-metrics.py`
2. Add to `telemetry_processing_worker.py`
3. Add database insert methods to `DatabaseManager`
4. Add `finishing_processed` flag to matches table
5. Include in event processing pipeline

See [finishing-metrics-implementation.md](finishing-metrics-implementation.md#next-steps) for detailed integration steps.

## Status

- ✅ Database tables created
- ✅ Processing script tested on 10 matches
- ✅ Data validated and queries verified
- ✅ Ready for production integration
