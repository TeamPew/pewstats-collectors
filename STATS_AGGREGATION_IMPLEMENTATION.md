# Stats Aggregation Worker Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified

The radar charts on https://www.pewstats.info/players were not displaying weapon statistics correctly because the aggregated stats tables (`player_damage_stats` and `player_weapon_stats`) were never being populated.

### Root Cause

The data pipeline was incomplete:

1. ✅ **Telemetry Processing Worker** extracts raw events:
   - `damage_events` table ← LogPlayerTakeDamage events
   - `weapon_kill_events` table ← LogPlayerKillV2 events

2. ❌ **MISSING STEP**: No process to aggregate raw events into stats tables

3. ⚠️ **API queries empty tables**:
   - `/api/v1/players/{name}/enhanced-stats` queries `player_damage_stats` and `player_weapon_stats`
   - Returns empty results → radar charts show no data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Stats Aggregation Worker

**Location:** `src/pewstats_collectors/workers/stats_aggregation_worker.py`

**Functionality:**
- Runs continuously with configurable interval (default: 5 minutes)
- Finds matches that need aggregation (`stats_aggregated = FALSE`)
- Aggregates `damage_events` → `player_damage_stats`
- Aggregates `weapon_kill_events` → `player_weapon_stats`
- Handles match types: `ranked`, `normal`, `all`
- Updates both specific and aggregate match types
- Marks matches as `stats_aggregated = TRUE`
- Exposes Prometheus metrics on port 9094

**Key Features:**
- Batch processing (configurable batch size)
- Non-blocking (doesn't slow down telemetry pipeline)
- Idempotent (uses INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Monitoring via Prometheus metrics

### 2. Database Migration

**Location:** `migrations/add_stats_aggregation_tracking.sql`

**Changes:**
- Adds `stats_aggregated` boolean column to `matches` table
- Adds `stats_aggregated_at` timestamp column to `matches` table
- Creates indexes for efficient aggregation queries
- Indexes on event tables for faster aggregation

### 3. Backfill Script

**Location:** `scripts/backfill_player_stats.py`

**Purpose:** One-time population of aggregated tables from existing data

**Features:**
- Aggregates all historical `damage_events` → `player_damage_stats`
- Aggregates all historical `weapon_kill_events` → `player_weapon_stats`
- Handles ranked/normal/all match types
- Marks all completed matches as aggregated
- Configurable batch processing
- Progress logging

### 4. Docker Compose Configuration

**Changes to:** `compose.yaml`

**Added service:**
```yaml
stats-aggregation-worker:
  - Runs stats_aggregation_worker.py
  - Configurable batch size and interval
  - Resource limits: 0.5 CPU, 512M memory
  - Auto-restart on failure
```

## Technical Details

### Aggregation Logic

#### Damage Stats
```sql
-- Groups by: player_name, weapon_id, damage_reason, match_type
-- Aggregates: SUM(damage), COUNT(*) hits
-- Creates records for: ranked, normal, and 'all' match types
```

#### Weapon Stats
```sql
-- Groups by: player_name, weapon_id, match_type
-- Aggregates: COUNT kills, headshots, knockdowns, distance metrics
-- Creates records for: ranked, normal, and 'all' match types
```

### Match Type Mapping
```python
competitive/ranked/esports → 'ranked'
normal/official/arcade → 'normal'
both ranked + normal → 'all'
```

### Performance Characteristics

**Expected throughput:**
- 100 matches per batch (default)
- ~10-20 seconds per batch (depends on events per match)
- Processes ~300-600 matches/hour

**Resource usage:**
- CPU: 0.25-0.5 cores
- Memory: 256-512MB
- Database: Minimal impact (batch inserts with ON CONFLICT)

**Latency:**
- Default 5-minute interval
- Stats typically available within 5-10 minutes of match completion

## Data Flow

```
Match Played
    ↓
Telemetry Downloaded
    ↓
Telemetry Processed → damage_events, weapon_kill_events
    ↓
[NEW] Stats Aggregated → player_damage_stats, player_weapon_stats
    ↓
API Query → /enhanced-stats
    ↓
Web UI → Radar Charts
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics

1. **Aggregation Rate**
   - `queue_messages_processed_total{queue_name="stats_aggregation"}`
   - Should match match completion rate

2. **Processing Duration**
   - `queue_processing_duration_seconds{queue_name="stats_aggregation"}`
   - Target: <20 seconds per batch

3. **Error Rate**
   - `worker_errors_total{worker_type="stats_aggregation"}`
   - Target: <1% of processed matches

4. **Database Operations**
   - `database_operation_duration_seconds{operation="aggregate_damage"}`
   - `database_operation_duration_seconds{operation="aggregate_weapons"}`
   - Target: <10 seconds per operation

### Health Checks

```sql
-- Aggregation lag
SELECT
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE stats_aggregated = FALSE) as pending,
    MAX(match_datetime) as oldest_pending,
    MAX(stats_aggregated_at) as last_aggregation
FROM matches
WHERE status = 'completed';

-- Stats table health
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT player_name) as players,
    COUNT(*) as records,
    MAX(updated_at) as last_update
FROM player_damage_stats;
```

## Testing

### Unit Testing
```bash
# Test aggregation logic
pytest tests/test_stats_aggregation_worker.py
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Test end-to-end flow
1. Insert test match with damage/weapon events
2. Run aggregation worker
3. Verify stats tables populated
4. Query API endpoint
5. Verify radar chart data returned
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# 1. Check worker is processing
docker compose logs -f stats-aggregation-worker

# 2. Verify data in database
psql -U pewstats_user -d pewstats_db
SELECT * FROM player_damage_stats LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM player_weapon_stats LIMIT 10;

# 3. Test API endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/players/PlayerName/enhanced-stats"

# 4. Check web UI
# Navigate to https://www.pewstats.info/players
# Search for player and verify radar charts
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Real-time Aggregation**
   - Trigger aggregation immediately after telemetry processing
   - Use RabbitMQ message instead of polling

2. **Incremental Aggregation**
   - Track last processed event timestamp
   - Only aggregate new events

3. **Distributed Processing**
   - Scale to multiple workers
   - Partition matches by shard key

4. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Time-series aggregations (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Player performance trends
   - Weapon meta analysis

5. **Caching Layer**
   - Cache frequently accessed player stats
   - Invalidate cache on new aggregations

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

```bash
# 1. Stop worker
docker compose stop stats-aggregation-worker

# 2. Verify system still functional
# (API will return empty stats, but won't crash)

# 3. Investigate logs
docker compose logs stats-aggregation-worker

# 4. Fix issues and restart
docker compose up -d stats-aggregation-worker
```

**No data loss:** Raw events remain in `damage_events` and `weapon_kill_events` tables and can be re-aggregated at any time.
