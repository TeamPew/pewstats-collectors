## üöÄ Next Steps

### Priority 1: Production Deployment (1-2 hours)

#### A. Deploy as Background Service

**Option 1: Systemd Service (Recommended)**

1. Create service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tournament-discovery.service
```

2. Add configuration:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=PewStats Tournament Match Discovery
After=network.target postgresql.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=rlohne
WorkingDirectory=/opt/pewstats-platform/services/pewstats-collectors
Environment="PYTHONPATH=/opt/pewstats-platform/services/pewstats-collectors/src"
ExecStart=/opt/pewstats-platform/services/pewstats-collectors/.venv/bin/python -m pewstats_collectors.services.tournament_match_discovery --continuous --interval 60 --sample-size 6
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Enable and start:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable tournament-discovery
sudo systemctl start tournament-discovery
sudo systemctl status tournament-discovery
```

4. Monitor logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u tournament-discovery -f
```

**Option 2: Docker Container**

1. Create Dockerfile (if not exists)
2. Build image
3. Deploy with docker-compose
4. Set up health checks

#### B. Configure Scheduling (Optional)

If tournaments only run on specific days/times:

```bash
# Edit the systemd service ExecStart line to add:
--schedule-enabled \
--schedule-days "0,1,2,3,6" \
--schedule-start "18:00" \
--schedule-end "00:00"
```

This will only run discovery Mon-Thu & Sun from 6 PM to midnight.

---

### Priority 2: Data Population (30-60 minutes)

#### A. Complete Player Roster

**Missing Data**:
- **De Snille Gutta**: 0 players (needs 4+)
- **EGKT**: 0 players (needs 4+)
- **BetaFrost White**: 4 players registered but not showing in matches (verify IGNs)
- **The8_nor**: Registered but no matches (verify IGN)

**Action Items**:
1. Get correct PUBG IGNs for all players
2. Verify IGNs match exactly (case-sensitive!)
3. Add players using template:

```sql
-- Get team IDs
SELECT id, team_name FROM teams ORDER BY team_name;

-- Add players (replace team_id and IGNs)
INSERT INTO tournament_players (player_id, team_id, preferred_team, is_primary_sample, sample_priority, player_role, is_active)
VALUES
('ExactIGN1', <team_id>, true, true, 1, 'IGL', true),
('ExactIGN2', <team_id>, true, true, 2, 'Fragger', true),
('ExactIGN3', <team_id>, true, false, 3, 'Support', true),
('ExactIGN4', <team_id>, true, false, 4, 'Support', true);
```

#### B. Verify Player IGNs

For players with 0 matches, check if IGN is correct:

```sql
-- Find players with 0 matches
SELECT tp.player_id, t.team_name
FROM tournament_players tp
JOIN teams t ON tp.team_id = t.id
WHERE tp.is_active = true
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM tournament_matches tm
    WHERE tm.player_name = tp.player_id
      AND tm.team_id = tp.team_id
  );
```

Common issues:
- Typos in IGN
- Case sensitivity (PUBG names are case-sensitive)
- Special characters
- Spaces vs underscores

---

### Priority 3: Monitoring & Observability (2-3 hours)

#### A. Add Prometheus Metrics

Create metrics endpoint for monitoring:

```python
# Add to tournament_match_discovery.py
from prometheus_client import Counter, Gauge, Histogram

matches_discovered = Counter('tournament_matches_discovered_total', 'Total matches discovered')
discovery_duration = Histogram('tournament_discovery_duration_seconds', 'Discovery duration')
players_sampled = Gauge('tournament_players_sampled', 'Number of players sampled')
```

#### B. Create Grafana Dashboard

Metrics to track:
- Matches discovered per hour
- Players matched vs not matched
- Discovery success rate
- API rate limit usage
- Team standings
- Player performance trends

#### C. Set Up Alerting

Alert on:
- Discovery service down for > 5 minutes
- No matches found for > 2 hours (during tournament)
- High failure rate (> 10%)
- API rate limit approaching

---

### Priority 4: API/Frontend Integration (4-8 hours)

#### A. REST API Endpoints

Create API endpoints for querying tournament data:

```python
# Example endpoints
GET /api/tournament/teams
GET /api/tournament/teams/{team_id}
GET /api/tournament/teams/{team_id}/matches
GET /api/tournament/teams/{team_id}/players
GET /api/tournament/matches
GET /api/tournament/matches/{match_id}
GET /api/tournament/leaderboard
GET /api/tournament/standings
```

#### B. Real-time Updates

Options:
- WebSocket for live match updates
- Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Polling every 60 seconds

#### C. Frontend Dashboard

Display:
- Live standings/leaderboard
- Recent matches
- Team performance graphs
- Player statistics
- Match history timeline

---

### Priority 5: Enhancements (Optional, 8+ hours)

#### A. Advanced Analytics

1. **Kill Heatmaps**: Track where teams get kills on each map
2. **Landing Zones**: Analyze landing patterns
3. **Engagement Analysis**: When/where fights happen
4. **Circle Analysis**: Performance by circle phase
5. **Weapon Stats**: Most effective weapons per team

#### B. Historical Data

1. **Season Tracking**: Track performance across tournament seasons
2. **Trend Analysis**: Week-over-week improvements
3. **Head-to-Head**: Compare team matchups
4. **Player Progression**: Track individual player growth

#### C. Notifications

1. **Discord Bot**: Post match results to Discord
2. **Email Notifications**: Daily summaries
3. **Slack Integration**: Team performance updates
4. **SMS Alerts**: For tournament organizers

#### D. Data Export

1. **CSV Export**: For Excel analysis
2. **PDF Reports**: Match summaries
3. **API Integration**: Feed data to tournament platforms
4. **Twitch Overlays**: Real-time stats for streams

## üìã Recommended Deployment Checklist

### Before Going Live

- [ ] Deploy discovery service (systemd or Docker)
- [ ] Verify service auto-starts on boot
- [ ] Complete player roster for all teams
- [ ] Verify all IGNs are correct
- [ ] Test continuous discovery for 30 minutes
- [ ] Check logs for errors
- [ ] Verify matches are being stored correctly
- [ ] Test player-to-team matching
- [ ] Set up basic monitoring (at minimum: systemd status checks)

### Week 1 Goals

- [ ] Service running 24/7 without failures
- [ ] All teams have complete rosters
- [ ] Player IGNs verified and matching
- [ ] Basic monitoring/alerting in place
- [ ] JSON export working for dashboards
- [ ] Documentation updated with any issues

## üîç Current System Performance

### Discovery Efficiency

- **API Calls Saved**: 90% (6 players vs 64 players per lobby)
- **Discovery Latency**: 1-2 minutes (60-second interval)
- **Sampling Coverage**: 9 players across 2 divisions
- **Match Filtering Accuracy**: 100% (only custom esports matches)

### Data Quality

- **Player Match Rate**: 44% (4/9 players found in matches)
  - Troublemakers II: 80% (4/5 players matched)
  - BetaFrost White: 0% (0/4 players matched - likely IGN issues)
- **Team Match Rate**: 25% (1/4 teams with match data)

### Recommendations

1. **Fix BetaFrost White IGNs**: 4 players registered but 0 matches suggests IGN mismatch
2. **Add remaining team rosters**: 2 teams (De Snille Gutta, EGKT) have no players
3. **Verify The8_nor IGN**: Registered but not appearing in matches
