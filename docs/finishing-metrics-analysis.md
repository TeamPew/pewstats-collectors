## üóÑÔ∏è Proposed Database Schema

### Two Tables:

**1. `player_knock_events`** - Event-level granular data
- Every single knock with full context
- **Knock distance** (attacker ‚Üí victim)
- **Teammate positions** at knock time:
  - Nearest teammate distance
  - Avg distance to all teammates
  - Count within 50m/100m/200m
  - Team spread variance
  - Individual teammate positions (JSON)
- Outcome (killed/revived)
- Combat details (weapon, headshot, etc.)

**2. `player_finishing_summary`** - Aggregated match stats
- Per-player, per-match summary
- Conversion rates and averages
- Distance breakdowns (CQC, close, medium, long)
- Team positioning averages
- Quality metrics (headshots, etc.)

---

## üéØ Strategic Insights Enabled

### **Performance Analysis:**
1. **Finishing efficiency** - How good are you at converting knocks?
2. **Optimal range** - What distance suits your playstyle?
3. **Team dependency** - Do you rely on teammates to finish?
4. **Improvement tracking** - Monitor progress over time

### **Tactical Questions Answered:**
1. **Does knock distance affect conversion?**
   - Data shows CQC = 100%, but long-range still 85%+

2. **Should I stay close to teammates?**
   - Can analyze if proximity correlates with success

3. **When should teammates help finish?**
   - Track who finishes whose knocks most effectively

4. **Are long-range knocks worth it?**
   - Risk vs reward based on conversion rates

5. **Am I playing too isolated?**
   - Track knocks when far from team support

### **Team Coordination:**
1. **Who finishes whose knocks** - Team synergy matrix
2. **Average assist time** - How fast do teammates help?
3. **Team cohesion score** - How well does team stay together?
4. **Support effectiveness** - Optimal team spacing

## üìà Sample Analysis Results

From the analyzed match:

### Best Finishers (100% conversion):
- Multiple players with perfect knock-to-kill conversion
- Avg self-finish time: 5-27 seconds
- Mix of close and long-range knocks

### Team Proximity Patterns:
- Most knocks had 2-3 teammates within 100m
- Nearest teammate typically 20-50m away
- Very few "isolated" knocks (200m+ from team)

### Distance Patterns:
- Most common: 10-50m engagements
- Long-range knocks (100m+) still finished successfully
- CQC knocks always self-finished (immediate control)

## üöÄ Implementation Approach

**Recommended: Integrate into existing telemetry processing**

### Why?
1. ‚úÖ Process data in real-time as matches complete
2. ‚úÖ Single source of truth from raw telemetry
3. ‚úÖ Can track complete knock lifecycle (knock ‚Üí kill/revive)
4. ‚úÖ Leverages existing infrastructure
5. ‚úÖ Captures data not available in existing tables

### Steps:
1. Create database migration for new tables
2. Add `extract_finishing_events()` to telemetry worker
3. Build position timeline from multiple event sources
4. Match knocks to outcomes (kills/revivals)
5. Calculate teammate positions at knock time
6. Aggregate per-player statistics
7. Insert into database with transaction

### Processing Logic:
```python
# 1. Build position map from all events
position_map = build_position_timeline(events)

# 2. Extract knocks
for knock in LogPlayerMakeGroggy events:
    # 3. Find outcome (kill or revive)
    outcome = find_outcome_for_knock(knock.dBNOId)

    # 4. Get teammate positions near knock time
    teammates = find_teammates_near_time(
        knock.timestamp,
        knock.team_id,
        position_map
    )

    # 5. Calculate distances
    knock_distance = knock.distance  # Already in event
    teammate_distances = calculate_distances(
        knock.attacker_location,
        teammate_locations
    )

    # 6. Store event
    insert_knock_event(...)

# 7. Aggregate summary
aggregate_player_stats(...)
```

## üìù Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Data exploration** - COMPLETE
2. **Schema creation** - Ready to implement
3. **Migration script** - Create SQL migration
4. **Worker implementation** - Add extraction logic
5. **Testing** - Validate with sample matches
6. **Backfill** - Process historical matches (optional)
7. **API/Dashboard** - Expose metrics for analysis

## üéì Key Takeaways

### What Makes This Powerful:

1. **Comprehensive** - Tracks entire knock lifecycle, not just kills
2. **Contextual** - Distance, team positioning, weapon, location
3. **Granular** - Event-level data enables deep analysis
4. **Aggregated** - Summary stats for quick insights
5. **Actionable** - Identifies specific areas for improvement

### Unique Insights You'll Get:

- **Personal playstyle profile** - CQC fighter vs long-range?
- **Team coordination quality** - How well do you work together?
- **Optimal engagement distances** - Where do YOU perform best?
- **Risk assessment** - When are knocks likely to escape?
- **Improvement tracking** - See progress in conversion rates

### Beyond Basic Stats:

This goes far beyond traditional "K/D ratio" by tracking:
- **Efficiency** (conversion rate, not just volume)
- **Context** (distance, team support)
- **Coordination** (who helps whom)
- **Quality** (headshots, wallbangs)
- **Positioning** (team cohesion)

## üí° Example Use Cases

### For Individual Players:
*"I average 15 knocks per match but only convert 60%. Data shows most knocks that escape are 100m+ when I'm isolated. Solution: Play closer to team or push faster after long knocks."*

### For Teams:
*"Player A gets lots of long-range knocks but teammate B is always 150m+ away. When B stays within 75m, conversion rate jumps from 55% to 85%. Action: B should maintain closer positioning during A's engagements."*

### For Coaching:
*"Player struggles with CQC (0-10m) finishing. Data shows he gets knocked himself 40% of the time in CQC. Focus training on close-quarters combat mechanics."*
