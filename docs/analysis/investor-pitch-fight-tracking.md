## The Third-Party Problem

### 🚨 When Good Fights Go Wrong

```
THIRD-PARTY ANALYSIS - 8 Detected Interventions

Fight #74  │ 4 teams │ 59s duration  │ 2 third parties
Fight #75  │ 3 teams │ 6s duration   │ 1 third party
Fight #79  │ 3 teams │ 49s duration  │ 1 third party
Fight #80  │ 3 teams │ 18s duration  │ 1 third party
Fight #84  │ 4 teams │ 28s duration  │ 2 third parties
Fight #89  │ 3 teams │ 31s duration  │ 1 third party

FINDING: 33% of all fights were third-partied
         Average third-party join time: ~20-30 seconds into fight
         Third-partied fights: 20% shorter (teams retreat faster)
```

**Business Insight**: Players **hate** being third-partied but have no data on:
- How often it happens to them
- When it typically occurs in fights
- Which map locations attract third parties
- How to position to avoid it

**Our system tracks all of this automatically.**
