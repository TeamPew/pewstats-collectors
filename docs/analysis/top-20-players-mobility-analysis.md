## Business/Competitive Implications

### For Player Development

**To improve from average to top-ranked**:
1. **Increase mobility** from 0.37 m/s to 0.8+ m/s (**+116%**)
2. **Increase movement** from 12.4m to 30+ m per fight (**+142%**)
3. **Execute 1-2 relocations per fight** (vs 0.1 average)

**Expected Results**:
- **+7-9pp survival rate improvement**
- **Better positioning and angles**
- **Harder to pin down/predict**

### For Analysis/Coaching

**Key Metrics to Track**:
1. **Mobility Rate** (m/s during fights) - Target: >0.6 m/s for competitive
2. **Movement Distance** (total meters) - Target: >25m per fight
3. **Significant Relocations** (25m+ moves) - Target: 0.2+ per fight
4. **Survival Rate** in fights - Target: >90%

**Coaching Recommendation**:
Train players to **rotate every 30-40 seconds** during fights. Data shows top-ranked players move **2.5x more** than typical players.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis

### 1. Deep-Dive on HaraldHardhaus (#1 Ranked)
- Analyze his 34 available matches manually
- Determine if he avoids fights or uses different strategy
- Compare to Kirin-Ichiban's approach

### 2. Expand Top-Ranked Player Sample
- Identify top 10 ranked players in database
- Analyze mobility patterns across all of them
- Confirm if 0.6-0.8 m/s is consistent for elite players

### 3. Outcome-Based Mobility Analysis
- Do mobile players WIN more fights (not just survive)?
- Does mobility differ between winning and losing teams?
- Is there an optimal mobility range (too much = reckless)?

### 4. Map/Terrain Analysis
- Does mobility vary by map (open vs urban)?
- Are mobile players more effective on certain terrains?
- Do circles/zones affect mobility decisions?
